## Introduction

This project is a Node.js Express server acting as a proxy for a JSON Server, providing a RESTful API for managing blog posts. It offers a robust solution for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog entries with custom error handling and logging.

## Features

- Full CRUD operations for blog posts
- Custom error handling with detailed error messages
- Error logging with stack traces for debugging
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Integration with JSON Server for easy data persistence

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhdHanish/blog_api_json_server.git
   cd blog_api_json_server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the JSON Server and Express server together:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. If running JSON Server separately:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```

2. Start the Express server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:server
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Error Handling

The API uses custom error handling. If an error occurs, the response will be in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error message here"
}
```

Errors are also logged to the console with stack traces for debugging purposes.
